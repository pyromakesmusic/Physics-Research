STIPULATIONS_ON_USE: The public domain data you have downloaded are contributed by the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Pandora Project, PI Thomas Hanisco. Central data processing with common algorithms is conducted under the direction of the NASA-ESA Pandonia Global Network
OTHER_COMMENTS: Lunar data may be included in this file, but no lunar viewing geometries are given. Lunar data may not be quality controlled. Lunar viewing geometries available upon request
Data quality flags may be given. Data quality flags correspond to:
0 = final/assured high quality
1 = final/assured medium quality
2 = final/assured low quality
10 = preliminary/not assured high quality
11 = preliminary/not assured medium quality
12 = preliminary/not assured low quality
It is recommended to only use data of high quality (0 and 10), however data of medium quality (1 and 11) are acceptable for use.To perform filtering without using data quality flags, only use data with NO2 uncertainty < 0.1 and Normalized rms < 0.01
RMS is the dimensionless spectral fitting residual. Normalized RMS includes algorithmic error
REVISION: R1
R1: Bug fixed with data quality flags
